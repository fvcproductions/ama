# Ask me anything! 🎉

Hi, I'm **Frances**. 😊

My personal logo happens to be a chocolate dipped strawberry - I'm very proud of this factoid. 🍓 🍫

On the webs, you can find me through the alias **["FVCproductions"](https://www.google.com/search?q=fvcproductions)**. 🌐

I tend to get a lot of questions by email. 📨

Instead of limiting answers to email threads, this repo allows anyone to view them! 👀

**Anything** means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### Here are some topics I think I know a lot about:
- coding bootcamps 🎒
- getting started as a developer 🍏
- fancy dev workflows/tooling 💻
- web design 🎨
- Fullstack Academy (proud alum) 🖖🏽
- being a double minority in tech (Latina) 🇵🇪
- how friggin' annoying it is to republish stuff 🙄

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com).
- Be civil and polite, please!
